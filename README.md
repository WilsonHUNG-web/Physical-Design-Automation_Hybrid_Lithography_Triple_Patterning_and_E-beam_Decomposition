# Hybrid_Lithography_Triple_Patterning_and_E-beam_Decomposition
<br>
The TPL problem is formulated into a shortest path problem. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find out the shortest path, which guarantees an optimal solution. An additional concern in this work (this paper) is to minimize the use of E-beam due to its low throughput. The use of E-beam causes extra edge cost. The objective is to find out the path which minimizes the total cost and thus it minimizes the use of E-beam.<br>

--How to compile-- <br>
In ./src directory:<br>

(1)Makefile:<br>
```
$ make
```
(2)Run the cases:<br>
```
$ ../bin/main [dmin] [../testcase/inputfile] [../output/outputfile]<br>
```
e.g.<br>
```
$ ../bin/main 0.0128 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_00128.out
```
(3)Verify the solution
```
$ ./Verify  [dmin] [../testcase/inputfile] [../output/outputfile]
```
e.g. <br>
```
$ ./Verify 0.0128 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_00128.out
```

Ps. <br>
You can also use the bash shell... runall.sh by the command:<br>
```
$ bash runall.sh
```
In the runall.sh, it looks like:<br>
```
echo "[dmin = 0.0128]"
../bin/main 0.0128 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_0.0128.out
../bin/main 0.0128 ../testcase/aes.out ../output/aes_0.0128.out
echo "     [M0, 0.0128]"
./Verify 0.0128 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_0.0128.out
echo "     [aes, 0.0128]"
./Verify 0.0128 ../testcase/aes.out ../output/aes_0.0128.out
echo "[dmin = 0.064]"
../bin/main 0.064 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_0.064.out
../bin/main 0.064 ../testcase/aes.out ../output/aes_0.064.out
echo "     [M0, 0.064]"
./Verify 0.064 ../testcase/M0.out ../output/M0_0.064.out
echo "     [aes, 0.064]"
./Verify 0.064 ../testcase/aes.out ../output/aes_0.064.out
```
